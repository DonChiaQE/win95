        <h3 class="underline font-bold text-md pb-1">About Me</h3>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            I’m a {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 2003 }} year old software engineer who’s a React Native and Vue.JS engineer by day but a native iOS developer by night. Crafting impactful software that serves my community and people around me is my passion.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            I thrive on staying updated with the latest design trends and development frameworks across all platforms. While my heart lies in native app design and development, I also excel in cross-platform app and web development, which keeps the bills paid.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            At 17, I co-founded NOSSAFLEX with developers from Australia and the US. Since then, it has garnered attention, being featured on local television, Apple’s annual Entrepreneur Camp, and earning a nomination from Apple’s regional team for their annual design awards.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            Having collaborated with diverse companies worldwide, from e-commerce to art and design industries, I've honed the ability to manage multiple projects simultaneously across various time zones.
        </p>
        <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
            In my spare time, I indulge in scrolling through analog camera listings or admiring my collection, although shooting has taken a backseat due to my various work commitments.

            Four years ago, NOSSAFLEX was conceived as a joint venture project between myself, Josh, our designer from Melbourne, and Diego, our lead developer from Virginia.

The app has since undergone multiple redesigns and has been featured on Channel 8 (Singapore), Apple's Entrepreneur Camp website, and was also recently submitted by Apple South Asia team for consideration in the Apple Design Awards.

                Yet another successful attempt at Apple's international coding
                competition. By making use of SwiftUI once more, I created a short app
                experience that explores recursive art patterns and abstract art. With
                the help of generative art, I was able to create a unique experience
                that most people would have rarely come across.

                My second try at Apple's international coding competition was finally a
                successful one. Making use of my prowess with web development, I decided
                to create a Swift Playground project that taught users how to make use
                of HTML and CSS to create a simple website.

            <p class="font-thin text-sm pb-2.5">
                Making use of Apple's SwiftUI framework as well as the nifty WKWebView
                API, I managed to create a working editor that would allow users to
                meddle with HTML and CSS. I proceeded to create a playground book
                project around that idea and came up with a tutorial sequence for the
                user to follow.

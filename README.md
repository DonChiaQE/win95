# FAQ
### Is this open source?
- Yes and no...? Most of my image assets are still living within the project itself as I haven't had the time to properly host them on an external server. Feel free to clone the project for your own perusal, be warned that it might be fairly large due to the images. The code's fairly messy right now and I plan to clean it up in the near future, but for now it will probably stay as such. 

### Is there an open source variant of this project?
- Yes! [Vue.js OS Template Project](https://github.com/dhs17y2adonchia/vuejs-os-template) is something I am working on right now! It's a barebones/MVP version of this project and it will hold all the required logic for windows and a variety of states to function minimally. All you'll need to do would be to add your own styling! Do drop a star or follow the project, stay tuned!

### Did you use any external CSS libraries to create the UI?
- Nope! Most of the code you see was manually crafted out by me, I took reference from a Windows 95 emulator slowly pieced together the UI with pure CSS

### How long did it take you?
- Approximately 1 week for the CSS stuff, most of the logic had already been assembled in the past in an older project I had a [MacOS variant](https://github.com/dhs17y2adonchia/portfolio-macos) of the project. 

### Does the mail app work?
- Yes, the mail app is linked to my google forms. 

### Can I contact you?
- Of course! [Email me](mailto:donchia@ymail.com)
